## Data Schema and API

The project utilizes two APIs to fetch the available charge boxes and their details, as well as additional parameters. The data schema for the charge box information is as follows:

```json
{
  "chargeboxes": [
    {
      "identifier": "ssd:charge-box:646b7dd3-671d-3dc6-a958-b2",
      "name": "Lemoine 10",
      "type": "Kino Urban",
      "location": {
        "latitude": 48.848595,
        "longitude": 2.336816
      },
      "address": "10 Rue Lemoine",
      "city": "Paris",
      "zipcode": "75004",
      "status": "free"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

The data schema for the additional parameters is as follows:

```json
{
  "chargebox_type": {
    "kino_pro": {
      "icon": "https://i.imgur.com/t61BNVn.png",
      "picture": "https://i.imgur.com/t61BNVn.png",
      "name": "Kino Pro 2x50kw"
    },
    "kino_one": {
      "icon": "https://i.imgur.com/qMp35ge.png",
      "picture": "https://i.imgur.com/qMp35ge.png",
      "name": "Kino One 2x22kw"
    },
    "kino_urban": {
      "icon": "https://i.imgur.com/IZzH5Bl.png",
      "picture": "https://i.imgur.com/IZzH5Bl.png",
      "name": "Kino Urban 2x7kw"
    }
  },
  "translations": {
    "fr": {
      "chargebox.status.free": "Disponible",
      "chargebox.status.in_use": "Occup√©e",
      "chargebox.status.booked": "R√©serv√©e",
      "chargebox.status.offline": "Indisponible",
      "cta.navigate_gmap": "S'y rendre (Google Maps)",
      "cta.booking": "R√©server une session"
    },
    "en": {
      "chargebox.status.free": "Available",
      "chargebox.status.in_use": "Busy",
      "chargebox.status.booked": "Booked",
      "chargebox.status.offline": "Unavailable",
      "cta.navigate_gmap": "Getting there (Google Maps)",
      "cta.booking": "Book a session"
    }
  }
}
```

The API endpoints used in the project are:

- Charge Boxes: https://run.mocky.io/v3/5dee5791-8e27-4736-a745-bcc3a61aaa59
- Parameters: https://run.mocky.io/v3/5a699583-9dc5-46a1-8888-52feb04a3dab

## Architecture

The project follows a component-based architecture using React. The main components and their responsibilities are as follows:

1. `api.tsx`: This component holds the API fetching functions, including error handling.
2. `ChargeBoxList.tsx`: This component uses the API fetching functions to populate the list of charge boxes.
3. `ChargeBoxItem.tsx`: This component represents an individual charge box item in the list and handles the expandable row functionality.
4. `ChargeBoxItemDetails.tsx`: This component displays the detailed information for a single charge box item.
5. `ChargeBoxStatus.tsx`: This component handles the display of the charge box status.
6. `LocationModal.tsx`: This component displays the interactive Leaflet map modal, showcasing the charge box and the user's location.
7. `distanceCalculator.tsx`: This component holds the logic for calculating the distance between the user and the charge box using the geolib library.

The separation of concerns ensures a modular and maintainable codebase. The data comes from the API and is fetched by the `api.tsx` component, which also handles the error handling. The other components use the data fetched by `api.tsx` to populate the list and display the charge box information. The `LocationModal.tsx` component is responsible for the interactive map, while the `distanceCalculator.tsx` component handles the distance calculation logic.
